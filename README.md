# Pure Charity Donations Plugin

A Plugin for showing a page with a general donation form.

It depends on the Pure Charity Base Plugin being installed and it's credentials configured to work.

# Installation

IMPORTANT:  At this time the plugin requires a name change after extracting from Github.  After downloading the source code from Github unzip the files and rename the folder **/purecharity-wp-donations** and compress as **purecharity-wp-donations.zip** if you plan to use the Wordpress plugin installer via upload.   

In order to install the plugin:

1. Copy the `/purecharity-wp-donations` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins` on your WP install
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. You're done!
